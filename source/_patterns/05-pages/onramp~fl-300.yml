        <p>The topic of the request is checked on the first page. Exactly what the person wants the Court to decide and why are on Pages 2-4 and any attachments.</p>
        <p>If \"Change\" is checked it means that there's already an order about this issue and the other party wants that changed.</p>
        <p>If \"Temporary emergency orders\" is checked it means the other party asked the court to decide something urgent before the hearing. If the Court agreed, item 7 at the bottom of Page 1 will be checked and the orders will be attached. These orders are temporary. They only last until the hearing. You must follow these orders.</p>
